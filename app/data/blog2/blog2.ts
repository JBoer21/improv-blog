const par1 = `When I think about struggling to adapt, I think back to when I moved to the US in 2017. I was an expatriate kid, and so starting boarding school in Boston was not my first time in the states, but it was my first time being completely surrounded by perhaps the scariest demographic for a somewhat international student: suburban American kids. `;

const par2 = `The experience was overwhelming. Every day, I was surrounded by kids who spoke and acted in a very different manner. Their humor eluded me, their collective psyche and thought processes seemed foreign, and their lifestyle was too fast to keep up with. It felt like I was drowning in every class and every social situation, with no escape to a home where I felt like people would understand me, as I lived on campus.`;

const par3 = `My initial response to this adversity was akin to that of a poor and inflexible improv partner – I, very stubbornly, clung to my own ‘plot’ and refused to build upon the offers of others in my new environment.`;

const par4 = `This mentality was very similar to the one I adopted in the first couple weeks of improv, when I was unbeknownst to the art of improv. I, like most people, have biases towards my own choices. I would rather do something my way than someone else’s way. At the start of my semester (first couple of classes), when given my who, what and where, my mind would race to find a storyline that would be humorous and logical in my own mind, and then, very much against the values of improv, would stick to that storyline as opposed to building off my partner, something I learnt to be a cardinal sin in improv.`;

const par5 = `Similarly, in my first couple months of boarding school, I harbored biases towards my own experiences and ways of doing things. I refused advances for off campus adventures towards foods I did not recognize, I chose not to attend events that did align with my own beliefs and interests (very sad looking back that I missed under the lights football Fridays). When asked about my opinions about sports I did not watch, my response was always in a manner that attempted to shame ‘boring American sports’. My conversations were always short.`;

const par6 = `I now realize that this approach goes against the core principles of both improv and cultural adaptation.`;

const par7 = `Looking back, I now see how this improv inflexibility mirrored by approach to cultural adjustment. It is very easy to play the victim in these situations, simply thinking “these people don’t understand me.” Viewing it from the perspective of improv reveals a very different truth. When one partner refuses to adapt and build off the other's ideas, the scene stagnates, leaving both parties stranded and frustrated.`;

const par8 = `To be clear, I'm not advocating for complete assimilation or loss of authenticity. I should not have simply ‘given in’ and rejected my own culture to adapt. Instead, the principles of improv could have helped me be more flexible. I could have adopted the idea of ‘yes, and’ in order to accept the reality of my new environment while also adding my own perspective and the philosophy of being spontaneous and being open to new experiences.`;

const par9 = `Adopting these improv principles would have helped me adapt better and created a more collaborative experience, by blending my unique background with the new culture I found myself surrounded by. This approach would have allowed for personal growth and cultural exchange, turning a challenging situation into an opportunity for creativity and connection.`;

const par10 = `Have no fear, as after a couple months of this adversity, I concluded that my approach was too inflexible. In November of my freshman year, I switched things up and my life changed for the better. I had a fantastic time at boarding school and would not trade it for anything.`;

const par11 = `Perhaps the most uncomfortable truth is that one must be uncomfortable to grow. Meandering in a stage of life where you are cozy and everything is sweet promises only stagnation, and so unfortunately the only way to move forward is to take risks. When thinking about adopting this mentality of risk taking, one instance comes into mind: choosing to move to New York.`;

const par12 = `After 3.75 lovely years at boarding school in Boston (the first 0.25 years were not that as fun as I shared above), my heart belonging to Beantown. Boston is awesome. All my friends live there, I love all the suburbs, the energy, the city, everything. Boston is my cozy and comfortable town.`;

const par13 = `Upon arriving at Hopkins, my mentality was always that I would spend my 4 years in university doing anything I could to return to Boston when I graduated. Boston was my place, and it was waiting for me to come back.`;

const par14 = `This line of thought influenced most of my choices during underclassmen years. When applying for internships and given the choice of city, I always chose Boston. By my sophomore year, I managed to get as close as Newark, New Jersey. But all my efforts were just reps, I was saving up for the big one: typically, if you play your cards right, the internship you complete the summer after your junior year is converted into a full-time role. This meant that wherever you work during this summer after junior year had a high possibility of where you will live when you graduate. Additionally, the recruitment cycle for these internships open a year in advance, and so the summer after my sophomore year of college, I was thinking about where I would want to live full time. Securing an internship in Boston would secure my goal of moving back when I graduated.`;

const par15 = `Flash forward to the end of my recruiting cycle, and I am faced with a choice: my interviewer asks me if I would prefer to work in the Boston office or the New York office. Freshman year Jehan would be appalled; I chose New York. I had known this choice was coming and had a lot of time to deliberate on it. Boston would be the safe and cozy choice. Everything I knew was there. I knew nothing about New York, and in fact wrote one of my college essays about how much I hated it. It would be a city filled to the brim with hustlers and uncomfortable experiences. I had to take the uncomfortable risk in order to move forward.`;

const par16 = `The physical manifestations of this choice came to light this past summer, which I spent in NYC. Let me tell you, New York is a lot. Within my first week I got mugged, and all I could think about was that I should have been in Boston. That being said, the uncomfortable environment of NYC and the risk I took of choosing to live there ended up pushing me forward. At the start of the summer, I knew no one in the city, and after 10 weeks, I left with too many friends to count, and experiences that changed me for the better. The risk paid off.`;

const par17 = `This risk embodies the philosophies of heightening and extending, two ideas we have learnt in improv recently.`;

const par18 = `Easily, the worst feeling in acting out an improv scene is feeling stagnant. The scene is going nowhere: random questions back and forth and no movement whatsoever. These scenes feel like little boxes; the ones acting them out feel stuck and the ones watching just feel sorry.`;

const par19 = `Evading these scenes is a must and can be done with the strategies of heightening and extending scenes, allowing actors to escape these tiny boxes. By taking the existing elements of the scene and asking yourself “if this unusual thing is true, what else is true” (UCB 125) you expand your built world ten-fold. It feels freeing.`;

const par20 = `The analogy here is that its cozy and easy to stay in the box, to ask random questions back and forth with your partner and stay stagnant in your scene. This makes the choice to do so appealing and safe. However, you cannot hold this mentality. Just like you must take risks to escape the box, you must also take risks to avoid the comfort and grow. Improv scenes are just like real life: you must heighten to move forward, otherwise things are just boring.`;

  text: "One of the key principles of improv is the concept of “yes, and.” This means accepting whatever is thrown your way and adding to it, rather than shutting it down. In a scene, this might look like agreeing with your scene partner’s suggestion and building upon it to create a more interesting and engaging story. In real life, this could mean being open to new ideas and perspectives, and being willing to collaborate with others to achieve a common goal.",
