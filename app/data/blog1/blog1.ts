const par1 = `Prior to this course, my motivation for taking an improv class was quite simple: it looked fun. If you have ever watched an improv show, you will know that they are remarkably hilarious. Over the past couple of years, I have had the benefit of going to a few improv shows, including the final presentation of this class, and experiencing the entertainment that is improv. `;

const par2 = `Another intuition that I gathered from watching was that being on the other side of it and actually doing the improv would be easy. In lots of cases, from the outside looking in, it feels like you can just say or do whatever you want. Shouldn’t be too hard, right? I am here to share that after the first couple weeks of class, actually being on the other side of the audience, all of my ideas about improv have been challenged greatly. Improv is not easy at all. `;

const par3 = `For those unfamiliar, improv (short for improvisation) is a form of live theater where the performers create scenes, characters, and dialogue on the spot, without any pre-planned script or rehearsal.`;

const par4 = `One major idea I have been introduced to recently is the concept of ‘Yes, and’, which is an agreement to never reject and always build off what your partner is saying; an agreement that all those in improv swear to. While I can vastly appreciate this agreement, it has been quite difficult to follow. In general, I, like everyone else, have biases that shape the choices I make. Whenever I am faced with the chance to make any choice, I call upon my instincts, shaped by the data of my many past experiences. As a result, it is awkard to reject my own intuition and blindly agree to someone else’s. While this may sound like I am over-engineering the game of improv, it is certainly something I have struggled with so far. When building a scene, my habit is to build it in my own way, but the rules of improv tell me to stray away from that. The agreement of ‘Yes, and’ has made me realize that improv is not as simple as I had assumed.`;

const par5 =
  "That being said, ‘Yes, and’ is a tool that will most definitely aid me in developing both my personal and professional development. On the topic of habitually wanting to follow my own way, this class has made me realize that I am not as great a listener as I thought I was. ‘Yes, and’ is a fantastic exercise because it forces you to be a better listener. To quote the UCB manual, “you cannot Yes and something if you haven’t heard it” (UCB manual, 40). Practicing the act of ‘Yes, and’ will make me a better listener and consequently, a better friend & teammate. Additionally, by embracing the 'Yes, and' approach, I will learn to value other's perspectives and contributions. It is conceited to believe that great outcomes come from individual brilliance as opposted to collective creativity (as Tina brilliantly mentions just below). Developing skills of this manner gives me something to excited about in my improv journey this semester.";

const par6 = `Here is a Ted Talk from the London School of Economcis explaining the applicaiton of 'Yes, and' beyond the stage:`;

const par7 = `Another impression about improv I have gathered in the first week or so of the class is that it requires a great deal of care for the individuals you are doing it with. When you are doing an improv scene with someone, you want to build off of each other and continue going, and not leave them stranded. A lot of trust must be shared between improv partners. This trust extends beyond the performance aspect; it’s about creating a safe space where everyone feels comfortable taking risks. You are giving your partner the power to be both creative and vulnerable. As the manual states, "You should look at every contribution that your scene partner makes to the scene as a gift" (UCB manual, 56).`;

const par8 = `While exciting to both create and be a part of such a space, it also adds a degree of nerve. You want to be contributing to the creation of said space, which is not easy. For me, there becomes a nervousness to be a great partner. I do not want to be the one to deny an idea, to be inattentive, to leave someone behind. "Denial means failing to agree with any aspect of the reality estbalished by your scene partner" (UCB manual, 57). This nerve is natural, I imagine, and these skills of being a good improv partner will improve as the class goes forward.`;

const par9 = `On the other side of things, in addition to being a good partner, it is important to have trust in the person on the other side. While trusting others blindly may not be the most natural thing, and it is easy to worry about "what's happening next" or "where is this going", a rule from the Well-Schooled Manual brilliantly reminds us to:`;

const par10 = `On the topic of rules, there are two great rules from Improv Classes and Coaching that stand out to me. I believe these rules can be used to integrate improv into my everyday life in an impactful way.`;

const par11 = `The first is rule 95: Let go of your great idea`;

const par12 = `Ironically, I think this really enforces the ideas I mentioned before, about how it is difficult to drop your intuition and just build off of what the person before you is saying. This idea is clearly important for improv, but also for real life. Being a good listener is not only about hearing what is being said, but also choosing to drop your own intuitions and desire to do things in your own way. In day-to-day life, I hope to adopt this rule. I think the impact it has will have is clear: it will make me a more empathetic listener and better friend/teammate.`;

const par13 = `The second rule is rule 79: Be boring`;

const par14 = `Another new thing I learnt so far in class is that trying to be funny is never actually funny. In improv, hilarity happens naturally – it is a product of the art. This is something I tend to struggle with. I love humorous jabs and invocations and quite honestly probably try to use them too much. In the context of improv, trying to be funny handicaps the scene. It limits creativity and the ability to build one idea into a larger one. Being boring in improv is something that I really want to follow.`;

const par15 = `This rule, of course, also applies to real life. Too many humorous injections can sometimes come across as facetious. Sometimes, it is better to just be boring and allow dialogs and conversations to be built. The impact of this rule is simply that, by forcing less funniness, you are more able to get into the meat of the topic at hand.`;

const par16 = `Here is a video of Jason Mantzoukas explaining the importance of rule 79:`;
