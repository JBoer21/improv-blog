const par1 = `I believe we have been given the opportunity to reflect on the final performance, so I am going to do that while still answering some of the "What can you change" questions. The final performance was this morning, and it felt fantastic.`;

const par2 = `The night before our improv show, I dreamt about how it would go. In my dream, I watched the other team perform, I saw my own team perform, and I saw myself perform. I woke up feeling ready and inspired as I had already created a good image in my head of what the show might look like. The actual performance was better than the show I dreamt about. It was fluid, funny, and overall, it just felt so natural. I can tell that I, as well as my peers, have grown so much. We have improved so much in our improvisation and overall have just gotten much more comfortable. I am so happy with the way things went. That being said, my happiness does not mean that there was nothing that could have been done better.`;

const par3 = `What do I want to change? I would be absolutely lying if I said I didn’t feel a little bit of a competitive spirit when comparing myself to the other group. I think they executed their short form improv terrifically. While I share the same sentiment with our first game, “Change,” I do think that our second game lacked a little bit. I really liked team No Butts’ dialogue style game, “And That’s How I Died.” I really think that in the setting with an audience, “And That’s How I Died” is an elite game. In all of these improv games, being given some context (for example, a word from the crowd) really makes a game more focused on improvisation as opposed to trying to find some sort of direction. “And That’s How I Died” is a fantastic game because it gives the context of 1) a starting idea and 2) a goal to achieve (how you died) that both add some clarity to how the improv works. Additionally, it’s all independent of what other performers do. You run by your own speed and craft your own narrative. Looking back, our dialogue-focused game, “Objection,” felt a little awkward. We could have done a better job expanding, but also, the style of the game just lacks some of the elements that really make a game enticing to an audience. “And That’s How I Died” really gives the individual some creative liberty, and the other team executed brilliantly.`;

const par4 = `On the other hand, our first short form game, “Change,” went great. I really think this game and the 2-3 person scenes capture the essence of true improv. With longer form improv, it becomes difficult to keep up with the growing narrative in a way that is digestible for the audience and the other performers. Our short form allowed us to show our ability to establish a reality and then expand on it immediately. Shoutout Jayden, because he was the MVP of our entire show. It was a genuine pleasure to do this scene with both him and Christine. He, Christine, and I did the ocean scene, and I think it really allowed us to showcase the skills we have developed over the past two months. We quickly established our three Ws, and then expanded almost automatically. Christine did fantastic with the work in coming off stage, and I think we did a good job expanding and heightening and giving ourselves lots to work with. On top of all that, I thought it was super funny too. Super proud of this scene.`;

const par5 = `Lastly, reflections on our longform. If I am being honest, longform has probably been the most challenging type of improv throughout the class. It feels like being put in a bubble with six other people and constantly trying to push on the edges of the bubble to expand it. The hardest part is that you must incorporate the expansions that other people add as well. It becomes difficult to follow the narrative, to try and act at the top of your emotions for your character in interactions with many other characters, and to build scenes in a way that is not confusing to an audience. Somehow, my group managed to end up at a small-town, parent-teacher conference-esque scene for the second long form in a row. I guess it's habitual; we tend to fall back on what has worked in previous weeks. Whether this is a good or a bad thing, I don’t know. I think, given the challenges of such a scene and doing it for an audience for the first time, we did great. I love how the norm for these types of scenes has become to all converge into one massive scene where everyone is on stage at the end. I am proud of my team for this scene as well.`;

const par6 = `Overall, the show went well. The experience has been so great, and it feels great, and I think my team can really hold our heads high up on this one.`;
